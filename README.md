![2D Gradient Descent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aks7816/Gradient-Descent-from-Scratch/main/2D%20Gradient%20Descent.gif)
This is a visualization of gradient descent on a 2D function. Here, the function being used is sin(x), and the gradient descent is used to find the minimum of the function.

This is a visualization of gradient descent on a 3D function. Here, the function being used is ```math
z(x, y) = \frac{\sin(5x) \cdot \cos(5y)}{5}
,and we are finding the minimum of this function starting from different points.
