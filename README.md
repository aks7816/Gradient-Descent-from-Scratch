![2D Gradient Descent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aks7816/Gradient-Descent-from-Scratch/main/2D%20Gradient%20Descent.gif)
This is a visualization of gradient descent on a 2D function. Here, the function being used is sin(x), and the gradient descent is used to find the minimum of the function.
![3D Gradient Descent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aks7816/Gradient-Descent-from-Scratch/main/3D%20Gradient%20Descent.gif))
This is a visualization of gradient descent on a 3D surface. The function being optimized is:

`z(x, y) = (sin(5x) * cos(5y)) / 5`

The goal is to find the minimum of this function, starting from different initial points. The visualization shows how multiple points move on the surface, descending towards the minimum using gradient descent.
